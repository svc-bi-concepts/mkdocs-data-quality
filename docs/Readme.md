This copy of project in TechnologyNotes is connected to BIC Github remote repo. Having the local version in OneDrive means I have my own cloud backed up version as well as it being available in BIC repo online.

There is an older copy of this project in source code folder in its own git local repo connected to SqeakyDuck Github remote repo
